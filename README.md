# Harder
Reinforcement Learning utilities in Python for improved research, learning and experimentation.


## About
While learning and working with different technologies I found myself writing the same code over and over. This repository is a way to abstract it away so I can focus on actual work, learning or ideas.

## Installation

### As `python` package

`pip install -U harder`

### As repository

1. `git clone https://github.com/jknthn/harder`
2. `cd harder`
3. Activate virtual environment of your choice
4. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
5. Play with it

## Citations

It might be far fetched on my end but as I plan to populate this repository with actual implementation both cutting edge and classic I imagine someone could use it. If you end up doing so, mention is appreciated! üôè
